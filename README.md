> ## 🤔 About
Introducing: The Chord Progression Generator 3000! As a student double majoring in Computer Science and Music, I've always wanted to work on a project that would marry both these passions of mine — and that's exactly what this is! Why a chord progression generator specifically? Well, during the songwriting process, designing just the right chord progression is what I struggle with the most. So, with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavacSript, I built something that designs it for me instead!

<br/>

> ## ⚙️ How it Works
1.  Select a key (an order of note names that the chord progression will be applied to) e.g. Key of D = D E F# G A B C# D
2.  Select a vibe (chord progressions expressed as roman numerals; applied on to the selected key) e.g. I, V, vi, I
3.  Click generate
4.  Chill out to your self-made masterpiece of a chord progression!

<br/>

> ## 🕺 Victories and 👷‍♂️ Improvements
1. 🕺 Successfully implemented an algorithm that maps a selected chord progression expressed as roman numerals onto a selected key.
2. 🕺 Produced and implemented garageband mp3 files for every single possible chord.
3. 🕺 Learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website!
4. 👷‍ Will need to figure out a way to make my code more modular and less redundant
2. 👷‍ Would have liked to add more possible chord progressions to choose from.


<br/>

> ## 🔭 Conclusion
Overall, had a lot of fun creating my first website with the added bonus of incorporating my two biggest passions in this world! In the future, I'd like to explore the world of generative music, and how to create a website that can take in user inputs to produce the chord progressions for a complete song, complete with intros, verses, bridges, choruses, etc.
