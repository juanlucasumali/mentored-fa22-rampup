> ## 🤔 About
Introducing: The Chord Progression Generator 3000! As a someone passionate in both **coding and music**, I've always wanted to work on a project that would **marry both these passions of mine** — and that's exactly what this is! Why a chord progression generator specifically? Well, during the songwriting process, designing just the right chord progression is what I struggle with the most. So, with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavacSript, I built something that designs it for me instead!

<br/>

> ## ⚙️ How it Works
1.  Select a key (an order of note names that the chord progression will be applied to) e.g. Key of D = D E F# G A B C# D
2.  Select a vibe (chord progressions expressed as roman numerals; applied on to the selected key) e.g. I, V, vi, I
3.  Click generate
4.  Chill out to your self-made masterpiece of a chord progression!

<br/>

> ## 🕺 Victories and 👷‍♂️ Improvements
1. 🕺 Successfully implemented an algorithm that maps a selected chord progression expressed as roman numerals onto a selected key.
2. 🕺 Produced and implemented garageband mp3 files for every single possible chord.
3. 🕺 Learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website!
4. 👷‍ Will need to figure out a way to make my code more modular and less redundant
2. 👷‍ Would have liked to add more possible chord progressions to choose from.


<br/>

> ## 🔭 Conclusion
Overall, had a lot of fun creating my first website with the added bonus of incorporating my two biggest passions in this world! In the future, I'd like to explore the world of **generative music**, and how to create a website that can take in user inputs to produce the chord progressions for a complete song, complete with intros, verses, bridges, choruses, etc.
